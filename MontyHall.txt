"""
THE SETUP
You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. 
Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) 
while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say 
it's just empty). 
You pick a door. 
Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. 
But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?

Write up some notes on this problem, including how you think Bayes' Rule might apply. Drop a link to your notes below and discuss it with your mentor.

I WROTE THIS PARAGRAPH BEFORE I READ THE WIKI-SOLUTION. 
IT IS THEREFORE A RECORD OF MY INSTINCT.

Whatever door you pick, Monty will never show you the car!
Never is a probability of 0.
It's not a conditional probability problem.
Re-imagine the show never making that first choice. IE cut straight to Monty eliminating a door for you.
The odds simply start at 50:50 and the odds never were 3:1, because Monty *ALWAYS* eliminates a dud door for you.
Shed any emotional baggage connected with an irrelevent first choice.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 


And yet... the question is pitched in the context of a Bayes's Theorem class... 
And so I'll challenge my above thinking by moving the edges...

Lets imagine, for elucidation it's not 3 but 100 doors and proceed... 
    (Expecting to loop back, changing 100s->3's and 99's->2's)

P( Door) = 0.01
P(~Door) = 0.99

Door   Correct    =   0.01    *   100    =   1
Door InCorrect    =   0.99    *   100    =   99

That time, the  1 time I correctly guessed, Monty will:
    Definately not open my door
    Open 1 of 99 others

Of the 99 times I mis-guess the first guess, Monty will
    Definately not open my door AND definately not open where it is, ie open one of 98 others

Recall that Monty never opens my door, or never reveals the car. ie He always eliminates one of the doors I didn't choose.
The chance that the car behind the doors I didn't choose, is 99 in 100 chance.
After he's has eliminated 1, the 99/100 chance is distributed evenly between 98 posibilites. or (99/100)/98 = 0.010102040816
I guess is the "re-distribution of chance" that is the key action that my instincts, at the top, missed.
Sticking with my first choice was:   1 in 100           or 100 in 10,000
Switch   from my first choice is now 1 in (99/100)/98   or 101 in 10,000

The odds are better if I switch.

I don't think the edge-widening helped the thinking process, but oh well.
Perhaps the best indicator of wrong thinking in my record of my first instincts
is my sentence: "Re-imagine the show never making that first choice."

That tossed out Monty's help, because, not only did he never show you the car, *HE NEVER RE-OPENS YOUR CHOSEN DOOR EITHER".
I seems he informing you about only 1 door, no, he does more.
He consider's your door.
He "re-distributes" mis-guess odds among fewer possibilies.

By the way, my hind-sight is 20 out of 20.
